1
00:00:29,471 --> 00:00:30,639
Aah!

2
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:43,819
Hey, good night, Sammy.

3
00:00:43,902 --> 00:00:46,155
G'night, Normulon.

4
00:00:48,324 --> 00:00:49,950
Mm.

5
00:00:52,828 --> 00:00:54,663
Ahh!

6
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:56,790
I'm sorry, sir, but
we're about to close.

7
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:00,127
Oh, I won't be long... Sammy.

8
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:11,430
Scarab: This might be
the most delicious tea

9
00:01:11,513 --> 00:01:13,474
I've ever tasted.

10
00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:17,686
I almost understand why
you abandoned your post

11
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:20,230
for this quaint life...

12
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,399
Kheirosiphon.

13
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:23,984
No.

14
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:33,535
You!

15
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:35,245
I'm not going back!

16
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,041
I don't like sacred flames.

17
00:01:39,124 --> 00:01:42,044
I like tea!

18
00:01:42,126 --> 00:01:45,172
Aaaaahhhh!

19
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,482
Who's next?

20
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:07,236
Hmm.

21
00:02:07,277 --> 00:02:08,445
No.

22
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:09,947
No.

23
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,407
Huh.

24
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,409
Finally.

25
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:43,480
Wyatt:

26
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:44,773
Aren't you gonna answer that?

27
00:02:46,442 --> 00:02:47,609
Ah...

28
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:48,819
Mr. P-Prismo...

29
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,612
Just ignore it.

30
00:02:50,696 --> 00:02:51,821
Make your wish.

31
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,490
Well, I'm trying to, but...

32
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:56,118
it's kinda... distracting.

33
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:57,745
You have no idea what it took.

34
00:02:57,828 --> 00:03:00,122
The terrible things I
did just to get here.

35
00:03:00,164 --> 00:03:02,541
And now I can't
even concentrate!

36
00:03:02,624 --> 00:03:05,127
The wish... Spit it out.

37
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:08,005
Oh. Ughh. Aagh!

38
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,632
Oh, I wish it
was quiet enough to think!

39
00:03:10,716 --> 00:03:12,509
Wish granted.

40
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:13,802
Oh, wait. Uh...

41
00:04:06,563 --> 00:04:07,690
Okay, fine.

42
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:16,699
A crossover. Okay.

43
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:22,705
Oh, hey! Ooo.

44
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:24,748
Hmm...

45
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,875
That's not a crossover.

46
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,919
Nope.

47
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:30,379
Nope.

48
00:04:30,421 --> 00:04:32,881
Oh, my gosh, you really
are Fionna and Cake!

49
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:34,341
The real ones!

50
00:04:34,383 --> 00:04:36,427
Oh, crud!

51
00:04:41,432 --> 00:04:42,975
Can we go on an adventure?

52
00:04:43,058 --> 00:04:44,852
Heh, well...

53
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:49,857
Aw, my hat!

54
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:52,735
Ayo! What's going
on now, Cake?

55
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:53,962
I don't know,

56
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:55,195
but this is cool.

57
00:04:55,237 --> 00:04:57,865
Ugh! What's wrong
with Cake's voice?

58
00:04:57,906 --> 00:05:00,617
Whoa! Big boy!

59
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,537
No, this is gonna drive me nuts.

60
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:04,788
Hey!

61
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:06,332
Hey!

62
00:05:06,415 --> 00:05:09,918
Heeeeeeeeeeeeey!

63
00:05:10,002 --> 00:05:12,588
Hmm. She's off-model, too.

64
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:19,511
Whoa! I'm standing
on my back legs!

65
00:05:19,595 --> 00:05:20,929
Oh! Arms!

66
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:23,432
Legs are arms!

67
00:05:23,515 --> 00:05:24,892
Amazing!

68
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:26,828
It's like a video game,
and we're getting upgrades

69
00:05:26,852 --> 00:05:29,772
for beating those weirdos.

70
00:05:31,106 --> 00:05:32,858
Ha! I can stretch!

71
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:34,818
He-eeey. Ha ha!

72
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:36,612
Much better.

73
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:37,821
Do me next!

74
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:42,785
Aw! I just wanted cool powers.

75
00:05:42,868 --> 00:05:44,620
Maybe you have some.

76
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:46,455
Try flying.

77
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:49,958
Ha ha! Faster! Faster!

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,294
These two are a
long way from home.

79
00:05:52,378 --> 00:05:54,004
But how?

80
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:56,382
Maybe the connection
is open again.

81
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:10,646
Nope. Still locked out.

82
00:06:10,688 --> 00:06:12,022
Then how did they get here?

83
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:14,817
I stepped through a portal
in that sad man's head.

84
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,944
Better take a closer look.

85
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:26,161
Now what?

86
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:29,081
For starters, let's
get you covered.

87
00:06:30,749 --> 00:06:32,376
Great.

88
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,838
What happened with this
one and this one, Simon?

89
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:37,297
I didn't do anything.

90
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:40,467
Liar. Crossovers
don't just happen!

91
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:44,179
Look, it seems like you two
have some stuff to work out,

92
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:46,181
so can you send us back to Ooo?

93
00:06:46,264 --> 00:06:47,182
Shh.

94
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:50,102
Let's try rewinding.

95
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:59,361
What the heck, dude?

96
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:01,655
Well, you couldn't
bring her back,

97
00:07:01,697 --> 00:07:03,032
so I helped myself.

98
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:04,366
Who's her?

99
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:06,243
I've got limits
to my power, bro.

100
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:09,038
That doesn't give you an
excuse to mess with my stuff.

101
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:11,582
Whatever, dude.

102
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,545
Simon, I mean it.

103
00:07:16,628 --> 00:07:21,175
Just because it's in your
head doesn't mean it's yours.

104
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:24,178
Ooooh, I've always wanted
to try one of these.

105
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:29,391
Drink the
water, you beast!

106
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:30,559
You...

107
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:34,271
You beast of burden,
drink the water.

108
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:37,191
Drink. Drink this water!

109
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:42,655
Hey! That's not a toy!

110
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:44,031
Bad cat!

111
00:07:44,073 --> 00:07:46,075
Aah! Why would you do that?!

112
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:48,702
Nobody sprays Cake!

113
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:50,162
Hyah!

114
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,417
Who do you think you
are, you big bully?

115
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:58,003
And why'd you bring us here?

116
00:07:58,087 --> 00:07:59,755
Where is here?!

117
00:07:59,838 --> 00:08:01,548
Okay, o-kay.

118
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,758
Chill.

119
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,218
Wow, okay.

120
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:08,097
I am Prismo the Wishmaster.

121
00:08:08,138 --> 00:08:10,307
That tells me nothing!

122
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:13,352
Well, as Wishmaster, I grant...

123
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:14,561
wishes.

124
00:08:14,603 --> 00:08:17,106
And sometimes those wishes
require me to create

125
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:19,233
new wish-altered realities.

126
00:08:21,026 --> 00:08:22,945
Here, check it out.

127
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:24,947
A wish made this
"farmworld" universe.

128
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,199
A wish made this
funny shape universe.

129
00:08:27,282 --> 00:08:29,159
This one already existed.

130
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:31,412
I don't even remember
whose wish this was.

131
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:32,705
Oh!

132
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:36,166
This universe is special
because it had my favorite guy.

133
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,377
Roooar! Pancake!

134
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,129
There he is! Heh heh heh.

135
00:08:40,212 --> 00:08:42,256
Dog person.

136
00:08:42,297 --> 00:08:44,216
Lotsa wishes, lotsa worlds.

137
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:46,969
The Time Room is the perch
from which I keep my eye

138
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:49,013
on the resulting multiverse.

139
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,265
Okay. Keep going.

140
00:08:51,306 --> 00:08:53,934
Uh, I used to
really like my job.

141
00:08:53,976 --> 00:08:56,979
But after eons of
making stuff for others,

142
00:08:57,062 --> 00:09:00,149
I wondered what it would be like
to make something for myself.

143
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,984
Let's see.

144
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:03,253
She's gonna be a good fighter,

145
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:05,404
so she'll need a badass sword.

146
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:09,074
Annnnd... everyone
needs a best friend.

147
00:09:09,158 --> 00:09:10,534
Ooh, cats are cool.

148
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:13,996
And now just to put them
in a big ol' tree house

149
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:16,790
on a grassy field
in a magical world.

150
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:18,667
Done.

151
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:20,336
Huh...

152
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:22,838
Shoot. Did I just
copy Finn and Jake?

153
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:25,632
Meh.

154
00:09:25,716 --> 00:09:27,134
So I just leaned into it.

155
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:29,345
Maybe it wasn't the most
creative thing I could make,

156
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:30,971
but I liked writing
your stories.

157
00:09:31,013 --> 00:09:32,890
Wait! That's us!

158
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:34,767
Yeah, totally.

159
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,643
You had adventure.

160
00:09:36,685 --> 00:09:37,853
You had romance.

161
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:39,063
DJ Flame!

162
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,522
You had friends.

163
00:09:40,564 --> 00:09:41,690
Gum-Garry.

164
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:44,443
Marshall's a vampire.

165
00:09:47,946 --> 00:09:50,532
Wow, we look so happy.

166
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:53,327
I knew my life was
supposed to be magic.

167
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:58,457
Fionna and Cake was
real this whole time?

168
00:10:01,877 --> 00:10:03,962
Pretty tight, right?

169
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:06,882
Yeah. So why'd you change it?

170
00:10:06,965 --> 00:10:10,135
Yeah, our world doesn't
look like that at all.

171
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:12,096
Everything's boring as hell.

172
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,765
Hmm.

173
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,558
Oh, I think I know
what happened.

174
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,227
No wonder you guys
looked so terrible

175
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:19,853
when you first got here.

176
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:21,689
Okay, so, technically,

177
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,816
I'm not supposed to
make stuff for myself.

178
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:27,152
So I kinda had to
"hide" your universe.

179
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:30,322
I found the emptiest,
most cursed magical brain

180
00:10:30,406 --> 00:10:31,740
in all of Ooo.

181
00:10:31,782 --> 00:10:32,908
Fionna: Him?

182
00:10:32,992 --> 00:10:34,118
Kinda.

183
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:39,957
Ice King!

184
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,417
Huh?

185
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,919
Hey, Ice King, can I store a
fan-made alternate universe

186
00:10:44,003 --> 00:10:45,212
in your cursed dome?

187
00:10:45,254 --> 00:10:46,588
Sure, magic flashlight!

188
00:10:46,672 --> 00:10:49,133
You can put anything
you want in there.

189
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,510
'Specially if it's
got a hot lady.

190
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:54,179
Cool. Hold still for upload.

191
00:10:54,263 --> 00:10:56,765
Whoa! Fire in the hole!

192
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,644
Fionna and Cake:
What time is it?

193
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:04,982
You were like a big
nutty hard drive.

194
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,275
And everything went great...

195
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:07,901
until you got cured.

196
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:11,780
Simon! Your crown!

197
00:11:11,822 --> 00:11:15,034
What's happenin', lady?

198
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:18,287
Don't panic, but I think
GOLB is digesting us...

199
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,414
breaking us apart
layer by layer...

200
00:11:20,456 --> 00:11:22,624
down to our essential forms.

201
00:11:24,126 --> 00:11:25,711
Betty?

202
00:11:25,794 --> 00:11:28,922
It's good to see you, Simon.

203
00:11:28,964 --> 00:11:31,383
It's good to be seen.

204
00:11:33,469 --> 00:11:36,805
Dang. From fun
wizard to sad loser.

205
00:11:36,847 --> 00:11:39,725
He wasn't fun. He was insane.

206
00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:42,811
I dunno. He looked
pretty happy to me.

207
00:11:42,853 --> 00:11:45,022
Prismo: Without the
curse of the magic crown,

208
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,940
Simon's brain was
no longer magical.

209
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:49,652
So your world must have
lost its magic, too.

210
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:52,696
And I've been locked
out ever since.

211
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,365
Oh, Betty.

212
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:56,492
So, all of this is really bad,

213
00:11:56,575 --> 00:11:59,328
but I think we're gonna be okay.

214
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:00,954
As long as no one else knows.

215
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:07,086
Oh, no!

216
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:09,296
Quick, down the stairs!

217
00:12:09,338 --> 00:12:10,839
What stairs?

218
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:12,633
Oh! Shoot.

219
00:12:14,593 --> 00:12:16,136
I'll deal with whoever that is.

220
00:12:16,178 --> 00:12:18,472
You guys follow me to the exit.

221
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:22,726
Up, up, up.

222
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,148
Just a minute!

223
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:35,990
Scarab! Hey!

224
00:12:36,031 --> 00:12:38,450
Curious.

225
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:42,371
I always thought you
had an open door policy.

226
00:12:42,454 --> 00:12:45,958
Everybody's pal, Prismo.

227
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,376
Hey! That's me!

228
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,795
Well, What brings
you here Scrabby?

229
00:12:49,878 --> 00:12:52,798
No one
calls me that anymore.

230
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:55,551
I was passing through
the neighborhood,

231
00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:58,095
making a delivery to
the Judgement Hall,

232
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,888
when I got an alert...

233
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,390
about you.

234
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:03,058
Me?

235
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,895
Your Universe Breach
Alarm went off twice

236
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:09,815
and went ignored?

237
00:13:09,898 --> 00:13:13,152
Oh. I just needed to
change the batteries.

238
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:16,530
Nothing for an important
guy like you to worry about.

239
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:20,617
Yeah, everything in the
Time Room is going great.

240
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:25,414
Yeah, well, thanks
for coming by.

241
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:28,417
I know you're really busy, so...

242
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:32,087
Prismo, it almost seems

243
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:35,257
like you're trying
to get rid of me...

244
00:13:35,341 --> 00:13:36,925
What? No, no!

245
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:38,802
I love it when you stop by.

246
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:41,597
Let's bro out! We can
party like we used to.

247
00:13:41,638 --> 00:13:44,516
I was never invited to parties.

248
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,353
Well, time to fix that.

249
00:13:51,982 --> 00:13:55,152
Ugh. We just want
to go back to Ooo.

250
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:56,654
Why are we hiding?

251
00:13:56,737 --> 00:13:58,089
Remember when I said
I wasn't supposed

252
00:13:58,113 --> 00:14:00,115
to create new
realities for myself?

253
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:01,492
It's actually a big deal

254
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,452
and I could get in
serious trouble for it.

255
00:14:03,535 --> 00:14:06,246
The guy who was at the
door, that's the Scarab.

256
00:14:06,288 --> 00:14:07,790
He's a jerk god-auditor.

257
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:10,376
And if he finds out about
you, he's gonna report me.

258
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:12,336
And then... gugh...

259
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:15,381
My boss is gonna
drop the hammer!

260
00:14:15,464 --> 00:14:17,257
Your boss?

261
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:18,467
Gah! Simon!

262
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:20,052
- Whoa!
- Fionna!

263
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:22,096
- Oof!
- Ugh!

264
00:14:22,137 --> 00:14:25,349
Ugh. Ow! Whoa!

265
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:33,440
It's okay, Fionna, walking
on two legs is hard.

266
00:14:33,482 --> 00:14:36,402
It's not my legs,
it's this damn skirt.

267
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:39,363
Girl, you look good though.

268
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,490
Weird. You never
had any trouble

269
00:14:41,532 --> 00:14:43,951
with skirts in my stories.

270
00:14:43,993 --> 00:14:46,161
Ah!

271
00:14:46,203 --> 00:14:47,496
How about shorts, huh?

272
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:50,541
What? What do you
mean "shorts"?

273
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:52,668
Uh, you know, mortals.

274
00:14:52,751 --> 00:14:54,813
I call them "shorts" because
they're smaller than us.

275
00:14:54,837 --> 00:14:57,339
And their lives
are really short.

276
00:14:57,423 --> 00:14:59,341
Having
two conversations

277
00:14:59,425 --> 00:15:01,176
at the same time is hard.

278
00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:11,311
Oh! That's mine.

279
00:15:11,353 --> 00:15:14,356
Is this cat hair yours, too?

280
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,734
I don't recall...

281
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:19,653
I'd like to take a
look around the cube

282
00:15:19,695 --> 00:15:21,780
and see if there are any more...

283
00:15:21,864 --> 00:15:24,491
"batteries" that need changing.

284
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:26,785
Oh, yeah, of course.

285
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:32,249
Uh-oh. We'll take a
shortcut through the core.

286
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,667
Pick up the pace, Simon!

287
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:36,211
You really don't want to
get caught by this guy!

288
00:15:36,295 --> 00:15:37,546
I don't care.

289
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:39,840
I mean, you show me
all my messed-up past

290
00:15:39,882 --> 00:15:43,385
and expect me to just shrug
it off like it's no big deal.

291
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:45,721
"Just move forward, Simon."

292
00:15:45,763 --> 00:15:48,390
Well, maybe I don't
want to move forward.

293
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:50,642
Maybe I just want
to sit right here.

294
00:15:50,726 --> 00:15:53,145
Ugh, this guy.

295
00:15:57,483 --> 00:15:59,735
Oh, sweet!

296
00:16:08,243 --> 00:16:10,079
Wow!

297
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:19,421
What the heck are those things?

298
00:16:19,505 --> 00:16:21,590
That's the Time Core.

299
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:23,676
I don't think they're
actually alive.

300
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,470
Maybe? They send time waves
throughout the multiverse

301
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:29,556
that are experienced
as the passage of time.

302
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:33,435
Now, see, you said
that word before,

303
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,853
and I pretended to understand,

304
00:16:34,937 --> 00:16:37,398
but I've got the
education of a house cat.

305
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:39,400
What's the multi-universe?

306
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:41,318
I'll show you.

307
00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:43,904
This is the multiverse,

308
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:46,615
a huge web of all the
different realities

309
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:49,243
elegantly connected
like an anthill

310
00:16:49,284 --> 00:16:51,996
or a camp counselor
relationship chart.

311
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,456
Where is our world on this map?

312
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,333
Your universe is...

313
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:58,919
unauthorized, so, it's...

314
00:16:58,961 --> 00:17:03,674
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
over here.

315
00:17:05,134 --> 00:17:07,803
Dang, that looks so lonely.

316
00:17:07,845 --> 00:17:11,640
Yeah, because I kind of made
your universe off the books,

317
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:13,976
it can't really be
part of the multiverse.

318
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:15,810
Just the fact that
you exist could have

319
00:17:15,853 --> 00:17:18,605
totally unpredictable effects
on the other realities.

320
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:20,774
You're like free radicals.

321
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:23,319
Awesome! That sounds cool!

322
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,987
Yeah...

323
00:17:32,161 --> 00:17:34,038
So majestic.

324
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:36,040
Trillions of waves of time

325
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:40,753
spreading across creation
in a mighty gush.

326
00:17:40,836 --> 00:17:43,297
Eh, the colors
give me a headache.

327
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:49,511
Prismo!

328
00:17:49,553 --> 00:17:52,514
Are we close?

329
00:17:52,556 --> 00:17:54,350
Just through this door.

330
00:17:56,685 --> 00:17:59,480
Finally! We're going
back adventurin'!

331
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:01,273
I can't wait!

332
00:18:01,357 --> 00:18:02,524
Huh? Huh?

333
00:18:02,566 --> 00:18:03,692
Is the circle ready?

334
00:18:03,776 --> 00:18:06,028
Just finished.

335
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:08,572
Oh, hey, what's up?
And the new battery?

336
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:10,741
You already know.

337
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:12,493
You're me. Ha-ha.

338
00:18:12,534 --> 00:18:13,869
Yeah, this is confusing.

339
00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:16,497
Prismo! Where's the exit?!

340
00:18:16,538 --> 00:18:18,082
It's been cool hanging out...

341
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:19,750
but you got to go back now.

342
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,168
- What!?
- What!?

343
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,504
Together: Simon... do the
thing with the portal!

344
00:18:23,545 --> 00:18:24,838
No way.

345
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,550
I am not going through
that heartache again.

346
00:18:28,592 --> 00:18:31,428
We're out, too!

347
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:34,264
- Stop!
- We go where we want!

348
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:36,308
Fionna! Cake!

349
00:18:38,143 --> 00:18:41,689
That's the last time I make
an unauthorized universe.

350
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,109
Unauthorized universe?

351
00:18:48,237 --> 00:18:49,613
Crap.

352
00:18:55,703 --> 00:18:57,496
What do you think about
the stuff he said?

353
00:18:57,579 --> 00:18:58,831
Are we not real people?

354
00:18:58,914 --> 00:19:01,458
Heck
yeah, we're real!

355
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:02,793
So what if he made us?

356
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,254
We're making our own
selves from now on!

357
00:19:05,337 --> 00:19:07,715
I always knew you
were a smart cat.

358
00:19:09,508 --> 00:19:11,468
Ugh!

359
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:13,095
Ah, come on, Scrabby.

360
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:15,764
Let's make a deal. I can
get you anything you want!

361
00:19:15,848 --> 00:19:18,142
A new ride? Big dung ball?

362
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:21,937
Ah! Not my hot n' spicy.

363
00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:25,774
You just handed me
the only thing I want.

364
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:31,238
My pickles? The Time Room!

365
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,866
I should have been Wishmaster,

366
00:19:33,949 --> 00:19:35,909
and I will be!

367
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:39,580
All I have to do is turn
in your rogue universe

368
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:42,124
to prove you're unworthy.

369
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,794
Pssh, what am I worried
about? You'll never find him.

370
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:47,755
It's hidden in a person?

371
00:19:47,796 --> 00:19:49,631
Crap, crap!

372
00:19:49,715 --> 00:19:51,550
He's here, isn't he?

373
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:53,344
No.

374
00:20:00,476 --> 00:20:01,810
I donked up.

375
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:04,229
Join the club.

376
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:11,987
We've been running for so
long, I'm gonna throw up.

377
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:15,240
There's a light up ahead.
It must be the exit!

378
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:18,327
Hold on!

379
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,501
- Adventure time!
- Adventure time!

380
00:20:25,584 --> 00:20:27,628
- Huh?
- Huh?

381
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,255
What's up?

382
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:31,423
What the heck?

383
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:33,676
Did you just make us go
through a big circle?

384
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,761
Okay,
we're out of time.

385
00:20:35,844 --> 00:20:38,305
You need to get back
inside his head now.

386
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:43,310
Found you!

387
00:20:43,352 --> 00:20:45,479
Ah, the crossovers.

388
00:20:45,521 --> 00:20:46,855
You're evidence.

389
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:49,191
You're getting egged, too.

390
00:20:50,526 --> 00:20:51,819
And after that,

391
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,739
into the incinerator with
the rest of the trash.

392
00:20:55,823 --> 00:20:58,075
Uh... no!

393
00:21:00,744 --> 00:21:02,454
They're Fionna and Cake...

394
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:04,873
and they go where they want!

395
00:21:09,795 --> 00:21:12,131
Run!
And keep running!

396
00:21:12,214 --> 00:21:14,550
This dude will hunt
you like a polar bear!

397
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:16,010
Prismo...

398
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:18,887
Hit the button and hold
on tight to each other!

399
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:24,852
What's the point?

400
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:28,439
Ow! You dum-dum!

401
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:31,567
If you don't help us,
Simon, our entire world

402
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:34,153
and everyone we know will die!

403
00:21:34,236 --> 00:21:37,031
Please! Help us!

404
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:40,242
Go!

405
00:21:46,332 --> 00:21:49,960
Actually, I think I
might be able to...

406
00:21:58,093 --> 00:22:00,095
Are we back in the magic world?

407
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:02,556
No, this doesn't look like Ooo.

408
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:08,604
What are we gonna do?

409
00:22:08,687 --> 00:22:13,400
That bug guy's still after
us and we can't take him on.

410
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:19,948
I used to be able to stop whole
armies of jerks like that,

411
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,742
but I'm useless now.

412
00:22:21,784 --> 00:22:24,036
Uh, yeah, we know.

413
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:26,705
Ooh! Maybe this
can get us back.

414
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:28,374
Yeah!

415
00:22:28,457 --> 00:22:29,667
Hmm... Hmm...

416
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,752
Let's just button mash it.

417
00:22:31,794 --> 00:22:33,545
Wait, wait, wait!
We don't know

418
00:22:33,629 --> 00:22:36,090
what channel number
corresponds to Ooo.

419
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:37,966
We could end right
back in the Time Room

420
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:41,095
where the Scarab will
bite my head off!

421
00:22:41,136 --> 00:22:43,639
Well, I could use a bite.

422
00:22:43,681 --> 00:22:45,140
I'm hungry, Fionna.

423
00:22:45,224 --> 00:22:48,185
I'll check my new backpack.

424
00:22:48,268 --> 00:22:51,814
Got anything in
that big ol' muumuu?

425
00:22:51,897 --> 00:22:53,357
Oh, found something.

426
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,609
Sandwiches!

427
00:23:01,699 --> 00:23:04,243
I know a way I can protect
you from the Scarab,

428
00:23:04,326 --> 00:23:08,288
bring back magic to your world,
and make it last forever.

429
00:23:09,164 --> 00:23:11,959
I need to become Ice King again.
